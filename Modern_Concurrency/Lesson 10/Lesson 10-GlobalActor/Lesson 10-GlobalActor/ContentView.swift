    /*As an iOS developer creating a `@globalActor` attribute in Swift, you need to consider several factors to determine whether to use a class, struct, or actor. Let's evaluate each option in the context of creating a global actor:

    1. **Class**:
    - **Use Case**: If you need shared mutable state that is accessed and mutated by multiple concurrent tasks, and you want changes to the state to be visible across all references, a class-based global actor might be appropriate.
    - **Example**: If you're creating a global actor to manage a shared cache or database connection that needs to be accessed and updated by different parts of your application concurrently, a class-based global actor could be suitable.

    2. **Struct**:
    - **Use Case**: If you prefer value semantics and want to ensure that the state is copied when passed between different parts of your application, and you don't need shared mutability, a struct-based global actor might be suitable.
    - **Example**: If you're creating a global actor to manage immutable configuration settings or state that doesn't need to be shared and mutated across different parts of your application, a struct-based global actor could be appropriate.

    3. **Actor**:
    - **Use Case**: If you need to enforce exclusive access to mutable state in a concurrent environment and want to protect against data races, an actor-based global actor is the most appropriate choice.
    - **Example**: If you're creating a global actor to manage a shared resource or state that needs to be accessed and mutated by multiple concurrent tasks, and you want to ensure that access to the state is serialized to prevent data races, an actor-based global actor would be the best option.

    In summary, the choice between class, struct, and actor for creating a `@globalActor` attribute in Swift depends on your application's requirements for reference vs. value semantics, the need for concurrent access to mutable state, and whether you want to protect against data races. If you need shared mutable state with reference semantics, use a class-based global actor. If you prefer isolated state with value semantics, use a struct-based global actor. If you require exclusive access to mutable state in a concurrent environment, use an actor-based global actor.
